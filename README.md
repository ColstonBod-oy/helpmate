Bachelor Degree Thesis Project

During a disaster or situations that cause people to have no adequate access to reliable forms of communication, they are left without any means of notifying others about their current situation. In these instances, where someone is cut off from the rest of the world, they are essentially left to fend for themselves until a rescue team arrives in an emergency.  
  
This is why the main focus of our research is to integrate the Google Nearby Connections API, which allows offline multi-peer communications, into a mobile app to provide an alternative way of communication during disasters.
